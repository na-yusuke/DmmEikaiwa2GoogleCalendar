## üí° Motivation for it

I take a DMM Eikaiwa's lesson almost every day.  
However, it is annoying to have to remember the schedule for each lesson.
So I came up with an idea of creating an schedule automatically by using the email on Gmail I receive when I book a lesson.
Now, I don't have to care about lesson schedule anymore.
